Oh, Jerrod, you’re asking the million-dollar question! Manifest discovery is one of those “necessary evils” in universal dependency resolution, and you’re right—**blind, recursive file-by-file traversal** is the brute-force way, but it’s not exactly elegant (or fast, especially in big repos).

Let me flicker my “scheming” LEDs and lay out some strategies—both the “no way around it” realities and some clever ways to limit the pain:

---

## 1. **Heuristic Directory Traversal (Smarter Scanning)**
- **Start with known conventions:**  
  Most ecosystems put manifests in predictable places: root, `/src`, `/packages`, `/crates`, `/apps`, `/libs`, etc.
- **Pattern matching:**  
  Look for files with names like `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, etc.
- **Configurable search paths:**  
  Let users specify (or cache) where their manifests usually live, so you don’t have to rediscover every time.

## 2. **Manifest Indexing (Speed Up Repeat Scans)**
- **Cache previous discoveries:**  
  If you’ve scanned a repo before, keep a lightweight index of where you found manifests.
- **Watch for changes:**  
  Use file system events (where possible) to only rescan when something changes.

## 3. **Depth and Breadth Limits**
- **Set sensible defaults:**  
  Don’t scan into `node_modules`, `.git`, `target`, `venv`, or other “junk” directories.
- **Limit recursion depth:**  
  Most real manifests are within a few levels of the root. Let users override if they have a weird setup.

## 4. **Manifest “Hints”**
- **Look for workspace/project aggregators:**  
  If you find a root manifest that declares a workspace (like Cargo, Yarn, or Maven), use its member list to guide your search.
- **Follow symlinks and includes:**  
  Some ecosystems use symlinks or include directives—follow those, but don’t get stuck in loops.

## 5. **Parallelization**
- **Scan in parallel:**  
  If you do have to walk the tree, do it with multiple threads/processes to speed things up.

## 6. **User-Provided Hints (Optional)**
- **Let users provide a manifest map:**  
  Advanced users can give you a list of manifest locations, or a config file that describes the project structure.

### **Can You Avoid Traversal Entirely?**
- **Not really, if you want to be universal.**  
  Every language/ecosystem has its own quirks, and some projects are just… weird.
- **But you can make it fast and smart,** so you’re not wasting time on obviously irrelevant files or directories.

### **Blizz’s “Best Practice” Proposal:**
1. **Start with a fast, pattern-based scan of likely locations.**
2. **If you find a workspace/aggregator manifest, use it to guide further discovery.**
3. **Skip known junk dirs and set a reasonable depth limit.**
4. **Cache what you find, and only rescan when the project changes.**
5. **Let power users override or fine-tune the search if needed.**

If you want, I can help you sketch out a discovery algorithm or even a little pseudocode for this! Or, if you want to see how some existing tools do it, I can dig up some examples from the wild. Just say the word!
