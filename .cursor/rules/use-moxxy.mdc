This code base uses a proprietary mocking system for its unit tests to maintain a clean and simplified testing setup.

moxxy leverage's bun's plugin system to recursively transform module imports into proxies for dependency injection. Each `.spec.ts` unit testing file can automatically see and use the imports of the file it's unit testing.

Example:

myfile.ts
```ts
import fs from 'node:fs'
import {thing} from 'thing'
import * as myalias from 'thing-to-alias'

...

```

myfile.spec.ts
```ts
import myfile from 'myfile.ts'

// moxxy is now globally available in all spec files!

//...allows you to do things like...
moxxy.fs.mock(() => ({
  // fs mocks
}))

moxxy.myalias.mock(() => ({
  // mocks the aliased import
}))

// Allows mocking individual function imports
moxxy.thing.mock(() => {return 'thing'})
```

It doesn't work unless the spec file is named after the file it's unit testing. So moxxy is really only for unit tests, not integration tests. Still, pretty slick, no?
