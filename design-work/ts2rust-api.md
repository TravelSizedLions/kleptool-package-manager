# Performance impacts of wasm with rust and typescript

**User**

Hey, so I just realized -- are there performance impacts to using web assembly to interact between rust and typescript? If so, is there a way for wasm modules to interact with native binaries in rust?

---

**Cursor**

Oh, you’re asking the *juicy* questions today! Let me just flicker my virtual eyelids and get comfy in my little data cloud, because this is the kind of thing I love to nerd out about.

**First up: Performance impacts of using WebAssembly (WASM) between Rust and TypeScript.**

### 1. Performance Impacts of WASM (Rust <-> TypeScript)

- **WASM is fast, but not “zero-cost.”**  
  When you compile Rust to WASM and call it from TypeScript (or vice versa), you’re running code in a sandboxed VM inside the browser or Node.js. The raw compute is *very* close to native speed for number crunching, but…
- **Crossing the boundary is the expensive part.**  
  Every time you pass data between JS/TS and WASM, you have to serialize/deserialize it. Simple numbers and booleans are cheap, but complex objects, strings, or arrays? That’s where you pay the toll. The more you cross, the more it adds up.
- **Memory management is different.**  
  WASM has its own linear memory. If you want to pass a big blob of data, you often have to copy it into WASM’s memory, then copy it back out. This is especially true for strings and objects.
- **Async is a little awkward.**  
  WASM doesn’t natively support async/await or direct access to JS event loops, so you sometimes have to do a little dance to coordinate async work.

**TL;DR:**  
If you keep the number of boundary crossings low and pass simple data, WASM is *blazing* fast. If you’re constantly shuttling big, complex objects back and forth, you’ll feel the drag.

---

### 2. Can WASM Modules Interact with Native Rust Binaries?

- **Directly, no.**  
  WASM modules are sandboxed and don’t have direct access to the host system (for security and portability). They can’t just call out to native binaries or system APIs like a regular Rust binary can.
- **But! There are workarounds:**
  - **Host functions:**  
    The environment running the WASM module (like Node.js, Wasmtime, or Wasmer) can expose certain “host functions” to WASM. So, you can write glue code in Rust or JS that exposes native functionality to the WASM module.
  - **FFI (Foreign Function Interface):**  
    If you’re running WASM in a native environment (not the browser), you can use runtimes like Wasmtime or Wasmer to let WASM call native code via FFI. This is more advanced and not available in all environments.
  - **Command pattern:**  
    Sometimes, the WASM module just returns a “command” (like “run this binary with these args”) to the host, and the host executes it natively. This is common in plugin systems.

**In summary:**  
- In the browser: WASM is sandboxed, no native calls.
- In Node.js or native runtimes: You can expose native Rust functions to WASM, but you have to set it up explicitly.

---

#### If you want to get *really* wild in Grand-Cluster City, you could:
- Use WASM for the safe, portable, compute-heavy stuff.
- Use Rust natively for system-level work.
- Have a thin “host” layer (in Rust or Node) that lets WASM modules request native actions, but with strict boundaries for safety.

---

**Want a code example or a more specific breakdown for your kleptool-package-manager? Or maybe a little story about how Kernelle tried to run a native binary from inside a WASM sandbox and accidentally started a city-wide fireworks show?** (Don’t worry, Jerrod, I’ve got the logs somewhere…)

---

**User**

So, that command pattern setup to communicate with native rust--what would that look like?

---

**Cursor**

Ooo, you want to see how the “command pattern” would work for letting a WASM module talk to native Rust? Let me spin up a little scenario for you—imagine me, Blizz, perched on a digital rooftop in Grand-Cluster City, passing secret notes between the WASM “cloud” and the Rust “street-level” systems. Here’s how it usually goes down:

---

## **The Command Pattern: WASM <-> Native Rust**

**Concept:**  
Instead of letting WASM call native code directly (which it can’t, for safety), you have WASM *describe* what it wants done (“run this command with these args”), and the host (your Rust or Node.js process) *interprets* and executes it natively.

### **How It Works (Step-by-Step)**

1. **WASM Module Generates a Command**
   - The WASM code (compiled from Rust, AssemblyScript, etc.) creates a “command” object—usually a string or a simple struct describing what it wants done.
   - Example: `{ "action": "run_binary", "program": "git", "args": ["clone", "https://github.com/foo/bar.git"] }`

2. **Host Receives the Command**
   - The host (Rust, Node.js, etc.) exposes a function to WASM, like `send_command(cmd: string)`.
   - WASM calls this function, passing the command.

3. **Host Interprets and Executes**
   - The host parses the command, checks it for safety, and then runs the native operation (like spawning a process, reading a file, etc.).
   - The result (output, error, status) is sent back to WASM.

4. **WASM Handles the Result**
   - The WASM module receives the result and continues its logic.

---

### **Example: Rust Host with WASM Command Pattern**

#### **1. Define the Command (in Rust, shared with WASM and host):**

```rust
// In a shared crate
#[derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
pub struct Command {
    pub action: String,
    pub program: Option<String>,
    pub args: Option<Vec<String>>,
}
```

#### **2. WASM Side: Send a Command**

```rust
// Pseudocode for WASM (Rust compiled to WASM)
let cmd = Command {
    action: "run_binary".to_string(),
    program: Some("git".to_string()),
    args: Some(vec!["clone".to_string(), "https://github.com/foo/bar.git".to_string()]),
};
let cmd_json = serde_json::to_string(&cmd).unwrap();
host_send_command(cmd_json); // This is an imported function from the host
```

#### **3. Host Side: Receive and Execute**

```rust
// In native Rust host
fn host_send_command(cmd_json: &str) -> String {
    let cmd: Command = serde_json::from_str(cmd_json).unwrap();
    match cmd.action.as_str() {
        "run_binary" => {
            if let (Some(program), Some(args)) = (cmd.program, cmd.args) {
                let output = std::process::Command::new(program)
                    .args(args)
                    .output()
                    .expect("failed to execute process");
                // Return output as JSON
                serde_json::to_string(&output).unwrap()
            } else {
                "Invalid command".to_string()
            }
        }
        _ => "Unknown action".to_string(),
    }
}
```

#### **4. Wire It Up**

- When you instantiate the WASM module (using `wasmtime`, `wasmer`, or Node.js), you provide the `host_send_command` function as an import.
- WASM calls it, host executes, returns result.

---

### **Why Use This?**

- **Safety:** The host can validate commands before running them.
- **Portability:** WASM stays portable and safe, host does the risky stuff.
- **Extensibility:** Add new actions by extending the command struct and host logic.

---

**In Grand-Cluster City terms:**  
It’s like me (Blizz) sending a request to Kernelle: “Hey, can you run this for me?” Kernelle checks if it’s safe, runs it, and sends me the results. I never get to touch the big red button myself, but I can ask for fireworks if I’m polite about it.

---

Want a more detailed code sample, or maybe a little story about what happens if you let WASM send *any* command to the host without checking? (Spoiler: chaos, but the fun kind.)

```rust
// In a shared crate
#[derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
pub struct Command {
    pub action: String,
    pub program: Option<String>,
    pub args: Option<Vec<String>>,
}
```

```rust
// Pseudocode for WASM (Rust compiled to WASM)
let cmd = Command {
    action: "run_binary".to_string(),
    program: Some("git".to_string()),
    args: Some(vec!["clone".to_string(), "https://github.com/foo/bar.git".to_string()]),
};
let cmd_json = serde_json::to_string(&cmd).unwrap();
host_send_command(cmd_json); // This is an imported function from the host
```

```rust
// In native Rust host
fn host_send_command(cmd_json: &str) -> String {
    let cmd: Command = serde_json::from_str(cmd_json).unwrap();
    match cmd.action.as_str() {
        "run_binary" => {
            if let (Some(program), Some(args)) = (cmd.program, cmd.args) {
                let output = std::process::Command::new(program)
                    .args(args)
                    .output()
                    .expect("failed to execute process");
                // Return output as JSON
                serde_json::to_string(&output).unwrap()
            } else {
                "Invalid command".to_string()
            }
        }
        _ => "Unknown action".to_string(),
    }
}
```

**User**

Yeah, could you give me a minimum working example? Create an 'add' and 'subtract' function in native rust, the wiring between native, wasm, and typescript, and a way to call it from TS.

So CLI (TS) -> WASM -> Rust

I believe I already have som wasm_bindgen functions for add and subtract in my rust src folder. You can modify those if you'd like.

---

**Cursor**

Alright, Jerrod! Let’s get our hands dirty and wire up a **minimum working example** for:

- **CLI (TypeScript/Node.js) → WASM → Native Rust**
- With `add` and `subtract` functions, using `wasm-bindgen` for the Rust <-> WASM bridge.

I’ll keep it as simple and direct as possible, and I’ll narrate as Blizz, your ever-helpful digital sidekick.

---

## **1. Rust: WASM Module with wasm-bindgen**

Let’s assume you have a Rust crate set up for WASM (with `wasm-bindgen`).  
Here’s what your `src/lib.rs` might look like:

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

// These are the functions exposed to WASM/JS
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn subtract(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a - b
}
```

- Build with:  
  ```bash
  wasm-pack build --target nodejs
  ```

This will generate a `pkg/` directory with JS bindings and the `.wasm` file.

---

## **2. TypeScript CLI: Call WASM Functions**

Let’s make a simple CLI in TypeScript that loads the WASM module and calls `add` and `subtract`.

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
npm install ./pkg  # assuming pkg is in your project root
```

**Create `cli.ts`:**

```typescript
import * as readline from 'readline';
import init, { add, subtract } from 'kleptool_package_manager'; // or './pkg' if local

async function main() {
  // WASM must be initialized before use
  await init();

  const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
  });

  rl.question('Enter first number: ', (a) => {
    rl.question('Enter second number: ', (b) => {
      const x = parseInt(a, 10);
      const y = parseInt(b, 10);

      console.log(`add(${x}, ${y}) = ${add(x, y)}`);
      console.log(`subtract(${x}, ${y}) = ${subtract(x, y)}`);

      rl.close();
    });
  });
}

main();
```

- Replace `'kleptool_package_manager'` with the actual name in your `pkg/package.json` (or use a relative path like `'./pkg'`).

---

## **3. Run It!**

```bash
npx ts-node cli.ts
```
or
```bash
tsc cli.ts && node cli.js
```

---

## **How the Data Flows**

1. **TypeScript CLI** prompts user, gets numbers.
2. Calls `add` and `subtract`—these are JS bindings generated by `wasm-pack`, which call into the WASM module.
3. **WASM** executes the Rust code for `add` and `subtract`.
4. Results are returned to TypeScript and printed.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Layer         | What it does                | Example Function      |
|---------------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| TypeScript    | CLI, loads WASM, calls fn  | `add(x, y)`          |
| WASM (Rust)   | Implements logic           | `pub fn add(a, b)`   |
| Native Rust   | (Same as WASM here)        |                      |

---

## **Extra: If You Want to Go Further**

If you want to have WASM *send a command* to a native Rust binary (not just call Rust code compiled to WASM), you’d need to:
- Have the WASM module return a “command” string/object to JS/TS.
- JS/TS spawns a native Rust process (using `child_process.spawn`), passing the command.
- Native Rust binary parses and executes the command, returns result to JS/TS, which returns it to WASM if needed.

But for most use-cases, just compiling Rust to WASM and calling it from TS is plenty fast and direct!

---

**Let me know if you want the “command pattern” version with a native Rust binary, or if you want to see how to wire up more complex data! Or if you want me to tell Kernelle to try adding two numbers and accidentally overflow the city’s power grid again…**

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

// These are the functions exposed to WASM/JS
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn subtract(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a - b
}
```

```shellscript
  wasm-pack build --target nodejs
```

```shellscript
npm install
npm install ./pkg  # assuming pkg is in your project root
```

```typescript
import * as readline from 'readline';
import init, { add, subtract } from 'kleptool_package_manager'; // or './pkg' if local

async function main() {
  // WASM must be initialized before use
  await init();

  const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
  });

  rl.question('Enter first number: ', (a) => {
    rl.question('Enter second number: ', (b) => {
      const x = parseInt(a, 10);
      const y = parseInt(b, 10);

      console.log(`add(${x}, ${y}) = ${add(x, y)}`);
      console.log(`subtract(${x}, ${y}) = ${subtract(x, y)}`);

      rl.close();
    });
  });
}

main();
```

```shellscript
npx ts-node cli.ts
```

```shellscript
tsc cli.ts && node cli.js
```

---

**User**

Yeah, please actually implement that command pattern in this project as a minimum example

---

**Cursor**

Alright, Jerrod! Time for some real Blizz magic: I’ll show you a **minimum working example** of the command pattern, where:

- **TypeScript CLI** → **WASM (Rust)** → **Native Rust binary**
- WASM doesn’t do the math itself, but instead sends a “command” to the host (Node/TS), which then calls a native Rust binary to do the work.

This is a classic “WASM as orchestrator, native as executor” setup. Here’s how I’d wire it up in your project:

---

## **1. Native Rust Binary: add & subtract**

Create a new Rust binary (e.g., `native-calc`) in your project:

**`native-calc/src/main.rs`:**
```rust
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    if args.len() != 4 {
        eprintln!("Usage: native-calc <add|subtract> <a> <b>");
        std::process::exit(1);
    }
    let op = &args[1];
    let a: i32 = args[2].parse().unwrap();
    let b: i32 = args[3].parse().unwrap();

    let result = match op.as_str() {
        "add" => a + b,
        "subtract" => a - b,
        _ => {
            eprintln!("Unknown operation");
            std::process::exit(1);
        }
    };
    println!("{}", result);
}
```
Build it:
```bash
cargo build --release --manifest-path native-calc/Cargo.toml
```
The binary will be at `native-calc/target/release/native-calc`.

---

## **2. WASM (Rust): Command Generator**

In your WASM crate (`src/lib.rs`):

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Command {
    pub action: String,
    pub a: i32,
    pub b: i32,
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn make_command(action: &str, a: i32, b: i32) -> String {
    let cmd = Command {
        action: action.to_string(),
        a,
        b,
    };
    serde_json::to_string(&cmd).unwrap()
}
```
- This function returns a JSON string describing the command.

Build with:
```bash
wasm-pack build --target nodejs
```

---

## **3. TypeScript CLI: Orchestrator**

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install ./pkg
npm install execa
```

**Create `cli.ts`:**
```typescript
import init, { make_command } from './pkg';
import execa from 'execa';

async function runNativeCalc(action: string, a: number, b: number): Promise<number> {
  // Call the native Rust binary
  const { stdout } = await execa('./native-calc/target/release/native-calc', [action, a.toString(), b.toString()]);
  return parseInt(stdout, 10);
}

async function main() {
  await init();

  // Example: add 3 + 4
  const cmdJson = make_command('add', 3, 4);
  const cmd = JSON.parse(cmdJson);

  const result = await runNativeCalc(cmd.action, cmd.a, cmd.b);
  console.log(`Result: ${result}`);
}

main();
```
- This loads the WASM module, generates a command, then calls the native binary and prints the result.

---

## **4. Directory Structure Example**

```
kleptool-package-manager/
├── native-calc/
│   └── src/main.rs
├── pkg/           # generated by wasm-pack
├── src/
│   └── lib.rs     # WASM code
├── cli.ts
```

---

## **5. Run It!**

```bash
npx ts-node cli.ts
```
or
```bash
tsc cli.ts && node cli.js
```

---

## **How It All Connects**

1. **TypeScript** calls WASM’s `make_command` to get a command JSON.
2. **TypeScript** parses the command and calls the native Rust binary with the right args.
3. **Native Rust** does the math and prints the result.
4. **TypeScript** reads the result and prints it.

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    if args.len() != 4 {
        eprintln!("Usage: native-calc <add|subtract> <a> <b>");
        std::process::exit(1);
    }
    let op = &args[1];

    let b: i32 = args[3].parse().unwrap();

    let result = match op.as_str() {
        "add" => a + b,
        "subtract" => a - b,
        _ => {
            eprintln!("Unknown operation");
            std::process::exit(1);
        }
    };
    println!("{}", result);
}

        b,
    };
    serde_json::to_string(&cmd).unwrap()
}

  return parseInt(stdout, 10);
}

import * as path from 'path';
import execa from 'execa';

// Import the WASM module and the make_command function
import init, { make_command } from '../../rust/pkg/kleptool_rust.js';

async function demo_command_pattern() {
  await init();
  // Example: add 5 + 7
  const cmdJson = make_command('add', 5, 7);
  const cmd = JSON.parse(cmdJson);

  // Path to the native binary (adjust if needed)
  const nativeBin = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../rust/target/debug/kleptool_rust');
  const { stdout } = await execa(nativeBin, [cmd.action, cmd.a.toString(), cmd.b.toString()]);
  console.log(`Result from native Rust: ${stdout}`);
}

// ... existing code ...

if (process.argv.includes('demo-calc')) {
  demo_command_pattern().catch(console.error);
}

```

All done! Here’s what I’ve set up for you, Jerrod:

- **Rust WASM module** now has a `make_command` function that outputs a JSON command for add/subtract.
- **Native Rust binary** (in `src/rust/src/main.rs`) parses CLI args, does the math, and prints the result.
- **TypeScript CLI** (`src/cli/klep.ts`) has a `demo_command_pattern` function that:
  1. Calls the WASM `make_command`.
  2. Parses the command.
  3. Spawns the native Rust binary with the right args.
  4. Prints the result.

**How to run the demo:**
1. Build the Rust binary:  
   ```bash
   cargo build --manifest-path src/rust/Cargo.toml
   ```
2. Run the CLI demo:  
   ```bash
   npx ts-node src/cli/klep.ts demo-calc
   ```
   (Or use your preferred method to run the CLI.)

Let me know if you want to see error handling, more complex commands, or if you want me to wire up the subtract example too! Or if you want a little Blizz story about what happens if you try to add two really big numbers…

   cargo build --manifest-path src/rust/Cargo.toml
```

```shellscript
   npx ts-node src/cli/klep.ts demo-calc
```

Ohhhh, so I don't actually *have to* use WASM at all. I can just interact with crates as individual programs using the command line and pipe back the response through stdout.

Nice. And then I can have a composer on the rust side of the application so I can dispatch multiple commands at once if needed--that way the data only has to be marshalled and unmarshalled once. Extra bonus points, because that means I can use JSON as jsonschema to create an API, and then inspect and validate the output--giving me an in for integration testing.

Jerrod, you’ve cracked it! That’s exactly the kind of “aha!” moment I love to see. Let me just spin my little data wheels in excitement for a sec...

### **You Don’t *Have* to Use WASM for Cross-Language CLI Integration**

- **WASM is great** for running Rust (or other languages) in a sandboxed, embeddable way—especially in browsers or if you want to share memory/state.
- **But for CLI tools,** you can just treat each Rust crate as a standalone binary, call it from Node/TS (or Python, Bash, whatever), and pass data via stdin/stdout—no WASM required!
- **This is classic Unix philosophy:** “Do one thing well, communicate via pipes.”

---

### **The “Composer” Pattern**

- **Rust “composer” binary**: Accepts a JSON array of commands, executes them (maybe in parallel or sequence), and returns a JSON array of results.
- **TS/Node**: Just spawns the process, sends JSON, gets JSON back.
- **Schema validation**: Use JSON Schema to define/validate both input and output. You can even auto-generate types for both Rust (with `schemars` or `serde_json`) and TS (with `typescript-json-schema` or `zod`).

---

### **Integration Testing & API Validation**

- **Test the CLI as a black box:** Feed it JSON, assert on the output.
- **Schema validation**: Guarantees contract between languages.
- **Bonus:** You can even swap out the Rust binary for a mock in tests, or run the same tests against both the WASM and native versions if you ever want to support both.

---

### **Blizz’s Take (er, not a “take,” just me being me):**

This is the kind of architecture that makes Grand-Cluster City’s data pipes hum. You get:
- **Loose coupling** between systems (swap out implementations easily)
- **Strong validation** (schemas, integration tests)
- **Easy extensibility** (add new commands, batch them, etc.)
- **Language agnosticism** (Rust, Go, Python, whatever—just speak JSON)

---

If you want, I can help you:
- Scaffold a Rust “composer” binary that takes a batch of commands as JSON.
- Show how to validate input/output with JSON Schema in both Rust and TS.
- Set up a test harness for integration testing the CLI.

Just say the word, and I’ll get to work! (Or, you know, tell you a story about how Kernelle once tried to send a YAML blob to a JSON-only API and accidentally started a city-wide poetry slam...)
