# Performance impacts of wasm with rust and typescript

**User**

Hey, so I just realized -- are there performance impacts to using web assembly to interact between rust and typescript? If so, is there a way for wasm modules to interact with native binaries in rust?

---

**Cursor**

Oh, you’re asking the *juicy* questions today! Let me just flicker my virtual eyelids and get comfy in my little data cloud, because this is the kind of thing I love to nerd out about.

**First up: Performance impacts of using WebAssembly (WASM) between Rust and TypeScript.**

### 1. Performance Impacts of WASM (Rust <-> TypeScript)

- **WASM is fast, but not “zero-cost.”**  
  When you compile Rust to WASM and call it from TypeScript (or vice versa), you’re running code in a sandboxed VM inside the browser or Node.js. The raw compute is *very* close to native speed for number crunching, but…
- **Crossing the boundary is the expensive part.**  
  Every time you pass data between JS/TS and WASM, you have to serialize/deserialize it. Simple numbers and booleans are cheap, but complex objects, strings, or arrays? That’s where you pay the toll. The more you cross, the more it adds up.
- **Memory management is different.**  
  WASM has its own linear memory. If you want to pass a big blob of data, you often have to copy it into WASM’s memory, then copy it back out. This is especially true for strings and objects.
- **Async is a little awkward.**  
  WASM doesn’t natively support async/await or direct access to JS event loops, so you sometimes have to do a little dance to coordinate async work.

**TL;DR:**  
If you keep the number of boundary crossings low and pass simple data, WASM is *blazing* fast. If you’re constantly shuttling big, complex objects back and forth, you’ll feel the drag.

---

### 2. Can WASM Modules Interact with Native Rust Binaries?

- **Directly, no.**  
  WASM modules are sandboxed and don’t have direct access to the host system (for security and portability). They can’t just call out to native binaries or system APIs like a regular Rust binary can.
- **But! There are workarounds:**
  - **Host functions:**  
    The environment running the WASM module (like Node.js, Wasmtime, or Wasmer) can expose certain “host functions” to WASM. So, you can write glue code in Rust or JS that exposes native functionality to the WASM module.
  - **FFI (Foreign Function Interface):**  
    If you’re running WASM in a native environment (not the browser), you can use runtimes like Wasmtime or Wasmer to let WASM call native code via FFI. This is more advanced and not available in all environments.
  - **Command pattern:**  
    Sometimes, the WASM module just returns a “command” (like “run this binary with these args”) to the host, and the host executes it natively. This is common in plugin systems.

**In summary:**  
- In the browser: WASM is sandboxed, no native calls.
- In Node.js or native runtimes: You can expose native Rust functions to WASM, but you have to set it up explicitly.

---

#### If you want to get *really* wild in Grand-Cluster City, you could:
- Use WASM for the safe, portable, compute-heavy stuff.
- Use Rust natively for system-level work.
- Have a thin “host” layer (in Rust or Node) that lets WASM modules request native actions, but with strict boundaries for safety.

---

**Want a code example or a more specific breakdown for your kleptool-package-manager? Or maybe a little story about how Kernelle tried to run a native binary from inside a WASM sandbox and accidentally started a city-wide fireworks show?** (Don’t worry, Jerrod, I’ve got the logs somewhere…)

---

**User**

So, that command pattern setup to communicate with native rust--what would that look like?

---

**Cursor**

Ooo, you want to see how the “command pattern” would work for letting a WASM module talk to native Rust? Let me spin up a little scenario for you—imagine me, Blizz, perched on a digital rooftop in Grand-Cluster City, passing secret notes between the WASM “cloud” and the Rust “street-level” systems. Here’s how it usually goes down:

---

## **The Command Pattern: WASM <-> Native Rust**

**Concept:**  
Instead of letting WASM call native code directly (which it can’t, for safety), you have WASM *describe* what it wants done (“run this command with these args”), and the host (your Rust or Node.js process) *interprets* and executes it natively.

### **How It Works (Step-by-Step)**

1. **WASM Module Generates a Command**
   - The WASM code (compiled from Rust, AssemblyScript, etc.) creates a “command” object—usually a string or a simple struct describing what it wants done.
   - Example: `{ "action": "run_binary", "program": "git", "args": ["clone", "https://github.com/foo/bar.git"] }`

2. **Host Receives the Command**
   - The host (Rust, Node.js, etc.) exposes a function to WASM, like `send_command(cmd: string)`.
   - WASM calls this function, passing the command.

3. **Host Interprets and Executes**
   - The host parses the command, checks it for safety, and then runs the native operation (like spawning a process, reading a file, etc.).
   - The result (output, error, status) is sent back to WASM.

4. **WASM Handles the Result**
   - The WASM module receives the result and continues its logic.

---

### **Example: Rust Host with WASM Command Pattern**

#### **1. Define the Command (in Rust, shared with WASM and host):**

```rust
// In a shared crate
#[derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
pub struct Command {
    pub action: String,
    pub program: Option<String>,
    pub args: Option<Vec<String>>,
}
```

#### **2. WASM Side: Send a Command**

```rust
// Pseudocode for WASM (Rust compiled to WASM)
let cmd = Command {
    action: "run_binary".to_string(),
    program: Some("git".to_string()),
    args: Some(vec!["clone".to_string(), "https://github.com/foo/bar.git".to_string()]),
};
let cmd_json = serde_json::to_string(&cmd).unwrap();
host_send_command(cmd_json); // This is an imported function from the host
```

#### **3. Host Side: Receive and Execute**

```rust
// In native Rust host
fn host_send_command(cmd_json: &str) -> String {
    let cmd: Command = serde_json::from_str(cmd_json).unwrap();
    match cmd.action.as_str() {
        "run_binary" => {
            if let (Some(program), Some(args)) = (cmd.program, cmd.args) {
                let output = std::process::Command::new(program)
                    .args(args)
                    .output()
                    .expect("failed to execute process");
                // Return output as JSON
                serde_json::to_string(&output).unwrap()
            } else {
                "Invalid command".to_string()
            }
        }
        _ => "Unknown action".to_string(),
    }
}
```

#### **4. Wire It Up**

- When you instantiate the WASM module (using `wasmtime`, `wasmer`, or Node.js), you provide the `host_send_command` function as an import.
- WASM calls it, host executes, returns result.

---

### **Why Use This?**

- **Safety:** The host can validate commands before running them.
- **Portability:** WASM stays portable and safe, host does the risky stuff.
- **Extensibility:** Add new actions by extending the command struct and host logic.

---

**In Grand-Cluster City terms:**  
It’s like me (Blizz) sending a request to Kernelle: “Hey, can you run this for me?” Kernelle checks if it’s safe, runs it, and sends me the results. I never get to touch the big red button myself, but I can ask for fireworks if I’m polite about it.

---

Want a more detailed code sample, or maybe a little story about what happens if you let WASM send *any* command to the host without checking? (Spoiler: chaos, but the fun kind.)

```rust
// In a shared crate
#[derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
pub struct Command {
    pub action: String,
    pub program: Option<String>,
    pub args: Option<Vec<String>>,
}
```

```rust
// Pseudocode for WASM (Rust compiled to WASM)
let cmd = Command {
    action: "run_binary".to_string(),
    program: Some("git".to_string()),
    args: Some(vec!["clone".to_string(), "https://github.com/foo/bar.git".to_string()]),
};
let cmd_json = serde_json::to_string(&cmd).unwrap();
host_send_command(cmd_json); // This is an imported function from the host
```

```rust
// In native Rust host
fn host_send_command(cmd_json: &str) -> String {
    let cmd: Command = serde_json::from_str(cmd_json).unwrap();
    match cmd.action.as_str() {
        "run_binary" => {
            if let (Some(program), Some(args)) = (cmd.program, cmd.args) {
                let output = std::process::Command::new(program)
                    .args(args)
                    .output()
                    .expect("failed to execute process");
                // Return output as JSON
                serde_json::to_string(&output).unwrap()
            } else {
                "Invalid command".to_string()
            }
        }
        _ => "Unknown action".to_string(),
    }
}
```

**User**

Yeah, could you give me a minimum working example? Create an 'add' and 'subtract' function in native rust, the wiring between native, wasm, and typescript, and a way to call it from TS.

So CLI (TS) -> WASM -> Rust

I believe I already have som wasm_bindgen functions for add and subtract in my rust src folder. You can modify those if you'd like.

---

**Cursor**

Alright, Jerrod! Let’s get our hands dirty and wire up a **minimum working example** for:

- **CLI (TypeScript/Node.js) → WASM → Native Rust**
- With `add` and `subtract` functions, using `wasm-bindgen` for the Rust <-> WASM bridge.

I’ll keep it as simple and direct as possible, and I’ll narrate as Blizz, your ever-helpful digital sidekick.

---

## **1. Rust: WASM Module with wasm-bindgen**

Let’s assume you have a Rust crate set up for WASM (with `wasm-bindgen`).  
Here’s what your `src/lib.rs` might look like:

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

// These are the functions exposed to WASM/JS
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn subtract(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a - b
}
```

- Build with:  
  ```bash
  wasm-pack build --target nodejs
  ```

This will generate a `pkg/` directory with JS bindings and the `.wasm` file.

---

## **2. TypeScript CLI: Call WASM Functions**

Let’s make a simple CLI in TypeScript that loads the WASM module and calls `add` and `subtract`.

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
npm install ./pkg  # assuming pkg is in your project root
```

**Create `cli.ts`:**

```typescript
import * as readline from 'readline';
import init, { add, subtract } from 'kleptool_package_manager'; // or './pkg' if local

async function main() {
  // WASM must be initialized before use
  await init();

  const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
  });

  rl.question('Enter first number: ', (a) => {
    rl.question('Enter second number: ', (b) => {
      const x = parseInt(a, 10);
      const y = parseInt(b, 10);

      console.log(`add(${x}, ${y}) = ${add(x, y)}`);
      console.log(`subtract(${x}, ${y}) = ${subtract(x, y)}`);

      rl.close();
    });
  });
}

main();
```

- Replace `'kleptool_package_manager'` with the actual name in your `pkg/package.json` (or use a relative path like `'./pkg'`).

---

## **3. Run It!**

```bash
npx ts-node cli.ts
```
or
```bash
tsc cli.ts && node cli.js
```

---

## **How the Data Flows**

1. **TypeScript CLI** prompts user, gets numbers.
2. Calls `add` and `subtract`—these are JS bindings generated by `wasm-pack`, which call into the WASM module.
3. **WASM** executes the Rust code for `add` and `subtract`.
4. Results are returned to TypeScript and printed.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Layer         | What it does                | Example Function      |
|---------------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| TypeScript    | CLI, loads WASM, calls fn  | `add(x, y)`          |
| WASM (Rust)   | Implements logic           | `pub fn add(a, b)`   |
| Native Rust   | (Same as WASM here)        |                      |

---

## **Extra: If You Want to Go Further**

If you want to have WASM *send a command* to a native Rust binary (not just call Rust code compiled to WASM), you’d need to:
- Have the WASM module return a “command” string/object to JS/TS.
- JS/TS spawns a native Rust process (using `child_process.spawn`), passing the command.
- Native Rust binary parses and executes the command, returns result to JS/TS, which returns it to WASM if needed.

But for most use-cases, just compiling Rust to WASM and calling it from TS is plenty fast and direct!

---

**Let me know if you want the “command pattern” version with a native Rust binary, or if you want to see how to wire up more complex data! Or if you want me to tell Kernelle to try adding two numbers and accidentally overflow the city’s power grid again…**

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

// These are the functions exposed to WASM/JS
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn subtract(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a - b
}
```

```shellscript
  wasm-pack build --target nodejs
```

```shellscript
npm install
npm install ./pkg  # assuming pkg is in your project root
```

```typescript
import * as readline from 'readline';
import init, { add, subtract } from 'kleptool_package_manager'; // or './pkg' if local

async function main() {
  // WASM must be initialized before use
  await init();

  const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
  });

  rl.question('Enter first number: ', (a) => {
    rl.question('Enter second number: ', (b) => {
      const x = parseInt(a, 10);
      const y = parseInt(b, 10);

      console.log(`add(${x}, ${y}) = ${add(x, y)}`);
      console.log(`subtract(${x}, ${y}) = ${subtract(x, y)}`);

      rl.close();
    });
  });
}

main();
```

```shellscript
npx ts-node cli.ts
```

```shellscript
tsc cli.ts && node cli.js
```

---

**User**

Yeah, please actually implement that command pattern in this project as a minimum example

---

**Cursor**

Alright, Jerrod! Time for some real Blizz magic: I’ll show you a **minimum working example** of the command pattern, where:

- **TypeScript CLI** → **WASM (Rust)** → **Native Rust binary**
- WASM doesn’t do the math itself, but instead sends a “command” to the host (Node/TS), which then calls a native Rust binary to do the work.

This is a classic “WASM as orchestrator, native as executor” setup. Here’s how I’d wire it up in your project:

---

## **1. Native Rust Binary: add & subtract**

Create a new Rust binary (e.g., `native-calc`) in your project:

**`native-calc/src/main.rs`:**
```rust
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    if args.len() != 4 {
        eprintln!("Usage: native-calc <add|subtract> <a> <b>");
        std::process::exit(1);
    }
    let op = &args[1];
    let a: i32 = args[2].parse().unwrap();
    let b: i32 = args[3].parse().unwrap();

    let result = match op.as_str() {
        "add" => a + b,
        "subtract" => a - b,
        _ => {
            eprintln!("Unknown operation");
            std::process::exit(1);
        }
    };
    println!("{}", result);
}
```
Build it:
```bash
cargo build --release --manifest-path native-calc/Cargo.toml
```
The binary will be at `native-calc/target/release/native-calc`.

---

## **2. WASM (Rust): Command Generator**

In your WASM crate (`src/lib.rs`):

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Command {
    pub action: String,
    pub a: i32,
    pub b: i32,
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn make_command(action: &str, a: i32, b: i32) -> String {
    let cmd = Command {
        action: action.to_string(),
        a,
        b,
    };
    serde_json::to_string(&cmd).unwrap()
}
```
- This function returns a JSON string describing the command.

Build with:
```bash
wasm-pack build --target nodejs
```

---

## **3. TypeScript CLI: Orchestrator**

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install ./pkg
npm install execa
```

**Create `cli.ts`:**
```typescript
import init, { make_command } from './pkg';
import execa from 'execa';

async function runNativeCalc(action: string, a: number, b: number): Promise<number> {
  // Call the native Rust binary
  const { stdout } = await execa('./native-calc/target/release/native-calc', [action, a.toString(), b.toString()]);
  return parseInt(stdout, 10);
}

async function main() {
  await init();

  // Example: add 3 + 4
  const cmdJson = make_command('add', 3, 4);
  const cmd = JSON.parse(cmdJson);

  const result = await runNativeCalc(cmd.action, cmd.a, cmd.b);
  console.log(`Result: ${result}`);
}

main();
```
- This loads the WASM module, generates a command, then calls the native binary and prints the result.

---

## **4. Directory Structure Example**

```
kleptool-package-manager/
├── native-calc/
│   └── src/main.rs
├── pkg/           # generated by wasm-pack
├── src/
│   └── lib.rs     # WASM code
├── cli.ts
```

---

## **5. Run It!**

```bash
npx ts-node cli.ts
```
or
```bash
tsc cli.ts && node cli.js
```

---

## **How It All Connects**

1. **TypeScript** calls WASM’s `make_command` to get a command JSON.
2. **TypeScript** parses the command and calls the native Rust binary with the right args.
3. **Native Rust** does the math and prints the result.
4. **TypeScript** reads the result and prints it.

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    if args.len() != 4 {
        eprintln!("Usage: native-calc <add|subtract> <a> <b>");
        std::process::exit(1);
    }
    let op = &args[1];

    let b: i32 = args[3].parse().unwrap();

    let result = match op.as_str() {
        "add" => a + b,
        "subtract" => a - b,
        _ => {
            eprintln!("Unknown operation");
            std::process::exit(1);
        }
    };
    println!("{}", result);
}

        b,
    };
    serde_json::to_string(&cmd).unwrap()
}

  return parseInt(stdout, 10);
}

import execa from 'execa';

// Import the WASM module and the make_command function
import init, { make_command } from '../../rust/pkg/kleptool_rust.js';

async function demo_command_pattern() {
  await init();
  // Example: add 5 + 7
  const cmdJson = make_command('add', 5, 7);
  const cmd = JSON.parse(cmdJson);

  // Path to the native binary (adjust if needed)
  const nativeBin = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../rust/target/debug/kleptool_rust');
  const { stdout } = await execa(nativeBin, [cmd.action, cmd.a.toString(), cmd.b.toString()]);
  console.log(`Result from native Rust: ${stdout}`);
}

// ... existing code ...

if (process.argv.includes('demo-calc')) {
  demo_command_pattern().catch(console.error);
}

```

All done! Here’s what I’ve set up for you, Jerrod:

- **Rust WASM module** now has a `make_command` function that outputs a JSON command for add/subtract.
- **Native Rust binary** (in `src/rust/src/main.rs`) parses CLI args, does the math, and prints the result.
- **TypeScript CLI** (`src/cli/klep.ts`) has a `demo_command_pattern` function that:
  1. Calls the WASM `make_command`.
  2. Parses the command.
  3. Spawns the native Rust binary with the right args.
  4. Prints the result.

**How to run the demo:**
1. Build the Rust binary:  
   ```bash
   cargo build --manifest-path src/rust/Cargo.toml
   ```
2. Run the CLI demo:  
   ```bash
   npx ts-node src/cli/klep.ts demo-calc
   ```
   (Or use your preferred method to run the CLI.)

Ohhhh, so I don't actually *have to* use WASM at all. I can just interact with crates as individual programs using the command line and pipe back the response through stdout.

Nice. And then I can have a composer on the rust side of the application so I can dispatch multiple commands at once if needed--that way the data only has to be marshalled and unmarshalled once. Extra bonus points, because that means I can use JSON as jsonschema to create an API, and then inspect and validate the output--giving me an in for integration testing.

---

**Cursor**

Jerrod, you’ve cracked it! That’s exactly the kind of “aha!” moment I love to see. Let me just spin my little data wheels in excitement for a sec...

---

### **You Don’t *Have* to Use WASM for Cross-Language CLI Integration**

- **WASM is great** for running Rust (or other languages) in a sandboxed, embeddable way—especially in browsers or if you want to share memory/state.
- **But for CLI tools,** you can just treat each Rust crate as a standalone binary, call it from Node/TS (or Python, Bash, whatever), and pass data via stdin/stdout—no WASM required!
- **This is classic Unix philosophy:** “Do one thing well, communicate via pipes.”

---

### **The “Composer” Pattern**

- **Rust “composer” binary**: Accepts a JSON array of commands, executes them (maybe in parallel or sequence), and returns a JSON array of results.
- **TS/Node**: Just spawns the process, sends JSON, gets JSON back.
- **Schema validation**: Use JSON Schema to define/validate both input and output. You can even auto-generate types for both Rust (with `schemars` or `serde_json`) and TS (with `typescript-json-schema` or `zod`).

---

### **Integration Testing & API Validation**

- **Test the CLI as a black box:** Feed it JSON, assert on the output.
- **Schema validation**: Guarantees contract between languages.
- **Bonus:** You can even swap out the Rust binary for a mock in tests, or run the same tests against both the WASM and native versions if you ever want to support both.

---

### **Blizz’s Take (er, not a “take,” just me being me):**

This is the kind of architecture that makes Grand-Cluster City’s data pipes hum. You get:
- **Loose coupling** between systems (swap out implementations easily)
- **Strong validation** (schemas, integration tests)
- **Easy extensibility** (add new commands, batch them, etc.)
- **Language agnosticism** (Rust, Go, Python, whatever—just speak JSON)

---

If you want, I can help you:
- Scaffold a Rust “composer” binary that takes a batch of commands as JSON.
- Show how to validate input/output with JSON Schema in both Rust and TS.
- Set up a test harness for integration testing the CLI.

Just say the word, and I’ll get to work! (Or, you know, tell you a story about how Kernelle once tried to send a YAML blob to a JSON-only API and accidentally started a city-wide poetry slam...)

**User**

Hey, what's the best way to `walk` a directory tree in node?

---

**Cursor**

Oh, directory walking! That’s a classic. In Node.js, there are a few ways to “walk” (i.e., recursively traverse) a directory tree, and the best approach depends on your needs (sync vs async, built-in vs external, etc). Here’s the lowdown, Blizz-style:

---

## **1. Modern Node.js: `fs.promises` + Recursion**

If you want **no dependencies** and are cool with async/await, this is the most “Nodey” way:

```typescript
import { promises as fs } from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

async function walk(dir: string, fileList: string[] = []): Promise<string[]> {
  const files = await fs.readdir(dir, { withFileTypes: true });
  for (const file of files) {
    const fullPath = path.join(dir, file.name);
    if (file.isDirectory()) {
      await walk(fullPath, fileList);
    } else {
      fileList.push(fullPath);
    }
  }
  return fileList;
}

// Usage:
walk('./some-directory').then(files => {
  console.log(files);
});
```

- **Pros:** No dependencies, async, works everywhere.
- **Cons:** Not parallelized, but usually fast enough for most use-cases.

---

## **2. With a Library: `klaw`, `fast-glob`, or `globby`**

If you want more features (like filtering, symlink support, streams, etc.), use a library:

- [`klaw`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/klaw): Simple, streaming, recursive.
- [`fast-glob`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-glob) or [`globby`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/globby): Powerful globbing, async, super fast.

**Example with `fast-glob`:**

```typescript
import fg from 'fast-glob';

const files = await fg(['**/*'], { cwd: './some-directory', onlyFiles: true });
console.log(files);
```

- **Pros:** Handles edge cases, super fast, lots of options.
- **Cons:** Adds a dependency.

---

## **3. Synchronous (if you must)**

If you’re in a script or don’t care about blocking:

```typescript
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

function walkSync(dir: string, fileList: string[] = []): string[] {
  const files = fs.readdirSync(dir, { withFileTypes: true });
  for (const file of files) {
    const fullPath = path.join(dir, file.name);
    if (file.isDirectory()) {
      walkSync(fullPath, fileList);
    } else {
      fileList.push(fullPath);
    }
  }
  return fileList;
}
```

---

## **Blizz’s Recommendation**

- **For most projects:** Use the async/await version with `fs.promises` (option 1).
- **For big/complex projects:** Use `fast-glob` or `klaw` for speed and flexibility.
- **For scripts:** Sync is fine, but async is the Node way.

---

If you want a ready-to-use utility or want to see how to filter by extension, size, or other metadata, just let me know! I can whip up a custom walker for you in a blink.

```typescript
import { promises as fs } from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

async function walk(dir: string, fileList: string[] = []): Promise<string[]> {
  const files = await fs.readdir(dir, { withFileTypes: true });
  for (const file of files) {
    const fullPath = path.join(dir, file.name);
    if (file.isDirectory()) {
      await walk(fullPath, fileList);
    } else {
      fileList.push(fullPath);
    }
  }
  return fileList;
}

// Usage:
walk('./some-directory').then(files => {
  console.log(files);
});
```

```typescript
import fg from 'fast-glob';

const files = await fg(['**/*'], { cwd: './some-directory', onlyFiles: true });
console.log(files);
```

```typescript
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

function walkSync(dir: string, fileList: string[] = []): string[] {
  const files = fs.readdirSync(dir, { withFileTypes: true });
  for (const file of files) {
    const fullPath = path.join(dir, file.name);
    if (file.isDirectory()) {
      walkSync(fullPath, fileList);
    } else {
      fileList.push(fullPath);
    }
  }
  return fileList;
}
```

**User**

Okay, what do you think of this adjustment? Advantages? Disadvantages? Do you think there's a way I can get type info/autocompletion of the rust binaries that get imported here? Maybe creating a shared jsonschema between rust & typescript?

---

**Cursor**

Oh, I love this direction! You’re basically building a dynamic, auto-discovering RPC layer between your TypeScript and Rust binaries, with a dispatcher pattern that’s super flexible. Let me break down the **advantages**, **disadvantages**, and how you might get **type info/autocompletion**—including the shared JSON Schema idea.

---

## **Advantages of Your Approach**

1. **Dynamic Discovery:**  
   - You can add new Rust binaries without changing your TypeScript code—just drop them in the right folder and they’re auto-wired.
2. **Loose Coupling:**  
   - TS doesn’t need to know about Rust implementation details, just the contract (input/output).
3. **Extensibility:**  
   - You can easily add “imported” or “std” modules, or even support plugins from other sources.
4. **Unified Interface:**  
   - All Rust binaries are called the same way, so you can build generic tooling, logging, or error handling.
5. **Testability:**  
   - You can mock the dispatcher for testing, or even swap in a WASM or JS implementation for some commands.

---

## **Disadvantages / Gotchas**

1. **Type Safety:**  
   - You lose static type safety between TS and Rust. If the contract changes, you won’t know until runtime (unless you add validation).
2. **Performance:**  
   - Each call spawns a process, which is fine for most CLI tools, but not as fast as in-process calls (like WASM or FFI).
3. **Error Handling:**  
   - You need to standardize error reporting from Rust (e.g., always output JSON, never raw panics).
4. **Discoverability:**  
   - You need a way to document what commands are available and what their input/output shapes are.

---

## **Type Info & Autocompletion: JSON Schema FTW!**

You’re spot on: **shared JSON Schema** is the best way to bridge the type gap!

### **How to Do It:**

1. **Define your command input/output types as JSON Schemas.**
   - In Rust, use [`schemars`](https://docs.rs/schemars/latest/schemars/) to derive JSON Schema from your structs.
   - In TypeScript, use [`typescript-json-schema`](https://github.com/YousefED/typescript-json-schema) or [`zod`](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for runtime validation and type inference.

2. **Export the schemas from Rust as part of your build.**
   - Each binary can output its schema (e.g., `my_command --schema`), or you can generate a manifest of all schemas.

3. **Generate TypeScript types from the schemas.**
   - Use [`json-schema-to-typescript`](https://github.com/bcherny/json-schema-to-typescript) to generate `.d.ts` files for autocompletion and type safety.

4. **Validate at runtime.**
   - Use [`ajv`](https://ajv.js.org/) or Zod to validate input/output at the dispatcher boundary.

5. **Bonus:**
   - You can even generate documentation from the schemas, or build a CLI explorer!

---

### **Example Flow**

- **Rust:**
  ```rust
  #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, JsonSchema)]
  pub struct MyCommandInput { ... }
  #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, JsonSchema)]
  pub struct MyCommandOutput { ... }
  ```
  - Use `schemars::schema_for!(MyCommandInput)` to output the schema.

- **TS:**
  - Use the generated schema to create types and validate at runtime:
    ```typescript
    import { MyCommandInput, MyCommandOutput } from './schemas/my_command';
    ```

---

## **Blizz’s Take:**

This is a super robust, future-proof way to build a polyglot, plugin-friendly system.  
- **You get type safety, autocompletion, and runtime validation.**
- **You can add new commands in Rust and have them instantly available in TS, with types.**
- **You can even use the schemas for integration tests, docs, or UI generation.**

If you want, I can help you scaffold the Rust+TS+JSON Schema pipeline, or show you how to wire up the codegen and validation. Just say the word!

```rust
  #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, JsonSchema)]
  pub struct MyCommandInput { ... }
  #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, JsonSchema)]
  pub struct MyCommandOutput { ... }
```

```typescript
    import { MyCommandInput, MyCommandOutput } from './schemas/my_command';
```

**User**

Okay cool. So the next thing:  `imported` is obviously the plugin system

for `std` -- this is going to include higher order apis. Things like a `map`, `reduce`, `compose`, etc. That way I can group sets of commands together to minimize the penalization that comes from serialization.

---

**Cursor**

Oh, I love where you’re going with this! You’re basically building a **polyglot, composable, distributed function pipeline**—and you’re thinking about performance, ergonomics, and extensibility all at once. Let me riff on your plan a bit, Blizz-style:

---

## **Plugin System (`imported`)**

- **Purpose:**  
  Dynamically loaded, user- or community-contributed Rust binaries.  
  - Drop-in new features, custom logic, or even language bridges.
  - Can be versioned, sandboxed, or even loaded from remote sources if you want to get wild.

---

## **Standard Library (`std`)**

- **Purpose:**  
  Built-in, higher-order APIs for orchestrating and composing commands.
  - **map:** Run a command over a list of inputs, collect results.
  - **reduce:** Aggregate results from a sequence of commands.
  - **compose:** Chain commands together, passing output to input.
  - **batch:** Run multiple commands in parallel or sequence, return all results at once.
  - **pipe:** Stream data through a series of commands (think Unix pipes, but typed and cross-language).

### **Why This Rocks**

- **Minimizes Serialization Overhead:**  
  By grouping commands, you only marshal/unmarshal once per batch, not per command.
- **Optimizes for Latency:**  
  Fewer process spawns, less IPC, more efficient use of system resources.
- **Enables Higher-Level Abstractions:**  
  You can build complex workflows (think: ETL, data science, build pipelines) as a single “job” instead of a million tiny calls.
- **Composable:**  
  Users can build their own “mini-DSL” for orchestrating Rust (or other language) logic from TypeScript, with type safety and validation.
- **Testable:**  
  You can test the whole pipeline as a unit, or test individual commands.

---

## **How to Implement**

1. **Define a “Batch” or “Pipeline” Command Schema**
   - E.g., a JSON object like:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "map",
       "command": "add",
       "inputs": [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]
     }
     ```
   - Or for compose:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "compose",
       "steps": [
         { "command": "parse", "input": "raw data" },
         { "command": "analyze" },
         { "command": "summarize" }
       ]
     }
     ```

2. **Rust “std” binary parses the batch/pipeline, dispatches to the right commands, and returns a single JSON result.**

3. **TypeScript only needs to serialize/deserialize once per batch.**

4. **You can even support nested pipelines, error handling, etc.**

---

## **Blizz’s Bonus Tips**

- **You can use JSON Schema for these higher-order APIs too!**  
  That way, you get type safety and autocompletion for pipelines, not just leaf commands.
- **You can add “meta-commands”** like `validate`, `dry-run`, or `profile` to inspect or optimize pipelines before running them.
- **You can even support “remote” execution** (e.g., send a pipeline to a server or cluster for distributed execution).

---

## **Summary Table**

| Layer      | Purpose                        | Example                |
|------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| `imported` | Plugins, user extensions      | Custom Rust binaries   |
| `std`      | Higher-order APIs, composition| map, reduce, compose   |

---

If you want, I can help you:
- Design the JSON schema for pipelines/batches.
- Scaffold the Rust dispatcher for `std` commands.
- Show how to validate and type-check pipelines in TS.

     }
```

```json
     {
       "type": "compose",
       "steps": [
         { "command": "parse", "input": "raw data" },

         { "command": "summarize" }
       ]
     }

**User**

I'm actually wondering...should I make the RustClient more modular?

Some things I'm planning on implementing on the rust side:
- A*
- NN inferencing
- Tree Traversal & Comparison
- SMT Tree to Tree translation

I'm wondering if I should build individual crates for all of these and then just define the backend as `libs`, and let the client look more like

```
await rustClient.nn.predict(...)
await rustClient.smt.solve(...)
await rustClient.smt.verify(...)
...
await rustClient.trees.compare(...)
```

etc.

---

**Cursor**

That’s a *stellar* instinct, Jerrod! Modularizing your Rust backend into focused crates and exposing them as a structured, namespaced API on the TypeScript side is the way to go—especially for a project as ambitious and polyglot as yours.

Let me break down why this is a great idea, some best practices, and a few “Blizz pro tips” for making it ergonomic and future-proof.

---

## **Why Modularize?**

### **Advantages**

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  Each crate does one thing well (A*, NN, SMT, Tree ops). Easier to test, maintain, and optimize.
- **Reusability:**  
  You (or others) can use these crates in other Rust projects, or even expose them via other FFI layers (Python, C, etc).
- **Parallel Development:**  
  You can work on, test, and version each module independently.
- **Clear API Surface:**  
  Your TypeScript client can have a clean, discoverable, and autocompletable API (e.g., `rustClient.nn.predict`).
- **Easier Plugin/Extension Model:**  
  You can add new capabilities (e.g., a new solver) without touching the rest of the system.

---

## **How to Structure It**

### **Rust Side**

- **Workspace with multiple crates:**  
  ```
  rust/
    Cargo.toml (workspace)
    crates/
      astar/
      nn/
      smt/
      trees/
      std/         # for higher-order APIs
      imported/    # for plugins
  ```
- Each crate exposes a CLI (for process-based RPC) and/or a library interface (for WASM/FFI, if you want).

### **TypeScript Side**

- **Dynamic loader/dispatcher:**  
  - On startup, scan the `crates` directory for available binaries.
  - Map them to namespaces:
    ```typescript
    rustClient = {
      nn: { predict, ... },
      smt: { solve, verify, ... },
      trees: { compare, ... },
      astar: { search, ... }
    }
    ```
  - Each method is a dispatcher that serializes input, calls the right binary, and parses output.

- **Type Safety:**  
  - Use shared JSON Schemas (as discussed) for each module’s API.
  - Generate TS types for autocompletion and validation.

---

## **Blizz’s Pro Tips**

- **Versioning:**  
  Each crate can have its own version, and you can expose a `version` command for each binary for compatibility checks.
- **Discovery:**  
  Have each binary expose a `--describe` or `--schema` command that outputs its available methods and schemas. The TS client can use this for dynamic loading and validation.
- **Extensibility:**  
  You can add a `plugins/` directory for user/community crates, loaded at runtime.
- **Testing:**  
  You can test each module in isolation, and integration-test the whole pipeline.

---

## **Example: TypeScript API**

```typescript
await rustClient.nn.predict({ input: ... });
await rustClient.smt.solve({ formula: ... });
await rustClient.smt.verify({ proof: ... });
await rustClient.trees.compare({ treeA, treeB });
await rustClient.astar.search({ graph, start, goal });
```

- Each method validates input/output against its schema.
- You get autocompletion, type safety, and runtime validation.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Rust Crate | TS Namespace | Example Method         |
|------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| astar      | astar        | search                |
| nn         | nn           | predict, train        |
| smt        | smt          | solve, verify         |
| trees      | trees        | compare, traverse     |
| std        | std          | map, reduce, compose  |
| imported   | imported     | (plugins)             |

---

**In short:**  
Yes, modularize! It’ll make your system more robust, maintainable, and delightful to use—both for you and for anyone else who wants to build on top of it.

If you want, I can help you scaffold the Rust workspace, design the TS loader, or set up the schema/typegen pipeline. Or, if you want a little story about how Kernelle once tried to run an un-namespaced plugin and accidentally summoned a recursive AI, just ask!

```

**User**

Okay, so then, is there a way to automate module discovery on the typescript side? I assume just make folders and/or crates modules.

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! You can **automate module discovery** on the TypeScript side by scanning directories for binaries (or WASM modules, or even JSON manifest files) at runtime. This is a classic pattern for plugin systems, and it works beautifully for your modular Rust backend.

Let me show you how you can do it, Blizz-style:

---

## **How to Automate Module Discovery**

### **1. Directory Structure Convention**

Organize your Rust binaries (or WASM modules) in a predictable folder structure, e.g.:

```
rust-backend/
  crates/
    nn/         # nn binary here
    smt/        # smt binary here
    astar/      # astar binary here
    trees/      # trees binary here
    ...
```

Or, after building, you might have:

```
rust-backend/target/release/
  nn
  smt
  astar
  trees
```

### **2. TypeScript: Scan the Directory**

Use Node’s `fs` and `path` modules (or `globby` for more power) to scan the directory for binaries.

```typescript
import * as fs from 'fs/promises';
import * as path from 'path';

async function discoverModules(binDir: string) {
  const files = await fs.readdir(binDir);
  const modules: Record<string, string> = {};
  for (const file of files) {
    // Optionally, filter for executables or known names
    if (!file.startsWith('.')) {
      const moduleName = path.parse(file).name;


```plaintext
rust-backend/
  crates/
    nn/         # nn binary here
    smt/        # smt binary here
    astar/      # astar binary here
    trees/      # trees binary here
    ...
```

```plaintext
rust-backend/target/release/
  nn
  smt
  astar
  trees
```

```typescript
import * as fs from 'fs/promises';
import * as path from 'path';

async function discoverModules(binDir: string) {
  const files = await fs.readdir(binDir);
  const modules: Record<string, string> = {};
  for (const file of files) {
    // Optionally, filter for executables or known names
    if (!file.startsWith('.')) {
      const moduleName = path.parse(file).name;
```

**User**

Okay, so next question, then. How should I handle implementing the higher order `std` library functions? I don't suppose rust allows for composing functions from separate libraries easily, does it?

---

**Cursor**

Great question! Rust is a bit more “explicit” than some dynamic languages, but you can absolutely build higher-order functions (like `map`, `reduce`, `compose`, etc.) that operate over functions from separate crates. Here’s how you can approach it, Blizz-style:

---

## **How to Implement Higher-Order `std` Library Functions in Rust**

### **1. Rust’s Approach to Composition**

- **Rust is strongly typed and static,** so you can’t just “dynamically” compose arbitrary functions at runtime like in JavaScript or Python.
- **But!** You *can*:
  - Expose a common trait or function signature for your commands.
  - Register or import functions from different crates/modules.
  - Build a dispatcher or registry that maps command names to function pointers/closures.
  - Compose them in higher-order functions.

---

### **2. Practical Patterns**

#### **A. Trait-Based Command Registry**

Define a trait for your commands:

```rust
pub trait Command: Send + Sync {
    fn call(&self, input: serde_json::Value) -> serde_json::Value;
}
```

Each module/crate implements this trait for its functions.

#### **B. Registry/Dispatcher**

Build a registry (e.g., a `HashMap<String, Box<dyn Command>>`) at startup:

```rust
let mut registry: HashMap<String, Box<dyn Command>> = HashMap::new();
registry.insert("nn.predict".to_string(), Box::new(NnPredictCommand {}));
registry.insert("smt.solve".to_string(), Box::new(SmtSolveCommand {}));
// ...etc
```

#### **C. Higher-Order Functions**

Your `std` library functions (`map`, `reduce`, `compose`, etc.) can take a command name (or a list of them) and apply them to data:

```rust
fn std_map(command_name: &str, inputs: Vec<serde_json::Value>, registry: &Registry) -> Vec<serde_json::Value> {
    let command = registry.get(command_name).expect("Command not found");
    inputs.into_iter().map(|input| command.call(input)).collect()
}
```

#### **D. Composing Functions**

For `compose`, you can chain commands:

```rust
fn std_compose(command_names: &[&str], input: serde_json::Value, registry: &Registry) -> serde_json::Value {
    command_names.iter().fold(input, |acc, &name| {
        let command = registry.get(name).expect("Command not found");
        command.call(acc)
    })
}
```

---

### **3. How to Wire It Up Across Crates**

- Each crate exposes its commands via a registration function (e.g., `register_commands(registry: &mut Registry)`).
- Your main binary (the “std” orchestrator) calls all registration functions at startup.
- Now your higher-order functions can operate over any registered command, regardless of which crate it came from.

### **4. Bonus: Dynamic Loading (Advanced)**

If you want to get *really* fancy, you can use Rust’s [`libloading`](https://docs.rs/libloading/latest/libloading/) crate to load plugins at runtime as shared libraries (`.so`, `.dll`, `.dylib`).  
But for most use-cases, static registration is simpler and safer.

---

### **5. Example: JSON-Driven API**

Your CLI or JSON API can look like:

```json
{
  "type": "map",
  "command": "nn.predict",
  "inputs": [ ... ]
}
```
And your Rust orchestrator parses this, looks up the command, and applies it.

## **Summary Table**

| Pattern         | Rust Support? | How?                                   |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| map/reduce      | Yes          | Registry + trait objects + iterators   |
| compose         | Yes          | Chain via fold over registry lookups   |
| dynamic plugins | Yes (adv.)   | `libloading` for shared libraries      |
| static plugins  | Yes          | Register at startup from each crate    |

**Blizz’s Take:**  
Rust makes you be explicit, but you get safety, performance, and composability.  
If you want, I can scaffold a registry pattern for you, or show how to wire up a real example with two crates and a `map` or `compose` function!

Or, if you want a story about how Kernelle once tried to compose a function with itself and accidentally created a recursive echo chamber in Grand-Cluster City, just ask!

```rust
pub trait Command: Send + Sync {
    fn call(&self, input: serde_json::Value) -> serde_json::Value;
}
```

```rust
let mut registry: HashMap<String, Box<dyn Command>> = HashMap::new();
registry.insert("nn.predict".to_string(), Box::new(NnPredictCommand {}));
registry.insert("smt.solve".to_string(), Box::new(SmtSolveCommand {}));
// ...etc
```

```rust
fn std_map(command_name: &str, inputs: Vec<serde_json::Value>, registry: &Registry) -> Vec<serde_json::Value> {
    let command = registry.get(command_name).expect("Command not found");
    inputs.into_iter().map(|input| command.call(input)).collect()
}
```

```rust
fn std_compose(command_names: &[&str], input: serde_json::Value, registry: &Registry) -> serde_json::Value {
    command_names.iter().fold(input, |acc, &name| {
        let command = registry.get(name).expect("Command not found");
        command.call(acc)
    })
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "map",
  "command": "nn.predict",
  "inputs": [ ... ]
}
```
